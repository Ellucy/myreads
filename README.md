# myreads

## Rationale

This Book tracking application allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The main page shows three shelves for books. Each book is shown on the correct shelf, along with its title and authors. The search page has a search input that allows users to search for books. Creating this project is one of the requirements to receive Nanodegree from Udacity. The project uses a backend provided by Udacity.
